---

## Prerequisites
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for Docker method)

# How To Run

### Run with Docker:

Make sure Docker Desktop is installed on your machine and is running then follow these steps.

1. **- Clone and navigate:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kleideris/nutrition-tracker.git
   cd nutrition-tracker
   ```

2. create a .env in the root and populate it with the variables needed for the frontend and backend (follow the .env.exaple template)
   ```dotenv
   SA_PASSWORD=<your db sa password>
   DB_CONNECTION=<your db connection string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your JWT secret> 

   VITE_PORT=3000
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   APP_UID=1000
   ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:8080
   ```

3. **Build and run the application (the first run can take up to 10 minutes to setup docker)**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **All done, the frontend runs at http://localhost:3000 and the backend API is accessed at http://localhost:5000/api**

<br>

### Alternative Running Method (Without Docker)
If you prefer or need to run the project manually, hereâ€™s how:

1. Generate Frontend & Backend .env Files
   You can auto-generate them from your root .env by running:

   ```bash
   cd _docker
   ./generate-envs.sh
   ```
   Make sure the script is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x _docker/generate-envs.sh
   ```

   Alternatively, create them manually from .env.example.

2. Start the Frontend
   ```bash
   cd client-frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Start the Backend
   ```bash
   cd server-backend/NutritionTracker.Api
   dotnet run
   ```

4. Create the SQL Server Database
You can manually create the NutritionTrackerDB or run the provided SQL script:
   ```bash
   sqlcmd -S <your_server> -U sa -P <your_password> -i _docker/init.sql
   ```

5. Inside client-frontend/package.json, youâ€™ll find helpful scripts that let you deploy the app from the frontend after initial setup:
- npm run start
- npm run start:frontend
- npm run start:backend

### Environment Variables

#### Backend
- SA_PASSWORD - The password used to authenticate with the SQL Server database
- DB_CONNECTION - Full connection string for accessing the database (e.g., Server, Database, User ID, Password)
- JWT_SECRET - Secret key used to sign and verify JWT tokens for secure API authentication

#### Frontend
- VITE_PORT - Port number for running the Vite development server (default: 3000)
- VITE_API_URL - URL of the backend API that the frontend will communicate with (default: http://localhost:5000/api)

#### Docker
- APP_UID - User ID used inside the container to avoid permission issues (default: 1000)
- ASPNETCORE_URLS - URL binding for ASP.NET Core app inside the container (default: http://0.0.0.0:8080)

---

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login/access-token` - Authenticates user credentials and returns a JWT token

### Users
- `GET /api/users` - Retrieves a paginated list of users that match the specified filter criteria
- `GET /api/users/{id}` - Retrieves a user by their id
- `GET /api/users/username?username=..` - Retrieves a user by their username
- `GET /api/users/admin-count` - Retrieves the total number of Admins
- `POST /api/users` - Registers a new user
- `PATCH /api/users/{id}` - Updates a user (only Admin can update other users)
- `PATCH /api/users/{id}/role` - Updates a user's role (Admin Only)
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}` - Deletes a use (Admin only)

### Meals
- `GET /api/meals/{id}` - Retrieves a specific meal by its Id
- `GET /api/meals/user-id/{userId}` - Retrieves all meals logged by a specific user
- `POST /api/meals/meal-type/{mealType}` - Logs a new meal
- `PUT /api/meals/{mealId}` - Updates the details of an existing meal
- `DELETE /api/meals/{mealId}` - Deletes a specific meal

### FoodItems
- `GET /api/food-items/search?query=..` - Searches for food items by name
- `POST /api/food-items` - Adds a new food item (Admin only)
- `DELETE /api/food-items/{id}` - Deletes a food item by its Id (Admin only)

---

## Authentication
- User login & registration with bcrypt password hashing
- JWT-based token system for protected routes

---

## Authentication Flow
- Register: POST /api/users
- Login: POST /api/auth/login/access-token
- Protected Routes: Require Authorization: Bearer <token> header

---

## Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend** - React (with Vite), React Router DOM <br>
- **Backend** - C#, ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8) <br>
- **Database** - SQL Server, Entity Framework Core <br>
- **Deployment** - Docker + `docker-compose` <br>
- **Tooling** - Studio, VS Code, SSMS

---

## Developer Notes
- All controllers inherit from BaseController, which provides access to the authenticated ApplicationUser via claims.
- Nutrition aggregation is handled manually via NutritionService.CalculateNutrition(...).
- Role-based authorization is enforced using [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")].
- An Admin and some food data are seeded in the database when first running the project.
- Only an Admin has access to FoodItem creation, deletion and is able to change the roles of other users to Admin.

---

## Troubleshooting
- Port conflicts: Ensure ports 3000 and 5000 are free.
- Missing .env: Double-check .env files exist in all required folders.
- JWT issues: Regenerate your secret using the Python command `python -c import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))`.

Here are common issues and how to resolve them:

- **Port Conflicts**  
  Ensure ports `3000` (frontend) and `5000` (backend) are not in use by other applications.

- **Missing `.env` Files**  
  Confirm that a `.env` file exists in the root directory. This file is essential for both Docker and manual setups.

- **JWT Secret Issues**  
  If your JWT tokens arenâ€™t working, regenerate a secure secret using:
  ```bash
  python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))"
